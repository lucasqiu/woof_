\f0\fs24 \cf0 David Moyes Sacked: Man Utd Shares Rise\
The manager is fired after 10 months in charge, as Manchester United shares rise 7% in New York during the first hours of trading.\
David Moyes has been sacked as Manchester United manager, with Ryan Giggs taking over until the end of the season.\
\
A statement on the club's website said: "Manchester United has announced that David Moyes has left the club.\
\
"The club would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role."\
\
Shortly after, it released another statement, saying: "Ryan Giggs, the club's most decorated player, will assume responsibility for the first team until a permanent appointment can be made."\
\
Moyes was informed of the decision to let him go this morning at the club's Carrington training ground, said Sky's Paul Kelso.\
\
Chief executive Ed Woodward is said to have told Moyes the news face to face.\
\
Manchester United shares rose 7% on the New York Stock Exchange during the first few hours of trading today.\
\
Speculation over the sacking started yesterday, after United's 2-0 weekend defeat to Moyes' former club Everton.\
\
The result left the champions in seventh place and made it impossible for them to qualify for next season's Champions League for the first time since 1995.\
\
The team has lost 11 times this season, six at home, and also endured defeats to bitter rivals Manchester City and Liverpool.\
\
There has reportedly been discontent among some of the club's top players during Moyes' time at Old Trafford.\
\
Moyes was handpicked by Sir Alex Ferguson after 11 years at Everton where he guided the team to five top-six finishes.\
\
The 50-year-old signed a six-year contract but is now set for a pay-off of around \'a34m - a year's salary - after less than a year in charge.\
\
Former Manchester United star Gary Neville - whose brother Phil was part of Moyes' backroom staff - told Sky he thought the manager should have been given more time, but admitted the club's form had taken a nose dive.\
\
"The results have been poor," said Neville.\
\
"As a fan, I haven't enjoyed watching it.\
\
"The performances have got worse and worse. There was a little bit of a pick-me-up at Christmas where you thought there might be a little bit of a run.\
\
"But in the last month or two the performances have deteriorated - Olympiakos, Liverpool and the Everton one were particular low points."\
\
Dwight Yorke, part of United's 1999 treble winning side, also told Sky Sports that Moyes had been a "huge disappointment".\
\
Ex-England striker Gary Lineker posted on Twitter: "Wish David Moyes all the very best. He's a good man and a good manager, just not the right fit for Manchester United."\
\
Favourites to replace the Scot include Louis van Gaal, manager of the Dutch national side, and Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp.\
\
Diego Simeone is also in the frame after a successful season at Athletico Madrid.\
\
But it is Old Trafford legend Giggs who will look to steady the ship for the remaining four games of the season.\
\
The club's American owners, the Glazer family, are thought to be ready to bankroll a summer spending spree of \'a3150m or more as the club pushes for a swift return to the top of the game.\
